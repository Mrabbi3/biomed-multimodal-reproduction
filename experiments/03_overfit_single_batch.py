"""
Experiment 03: Overfit Single Batch ("Golden Test")
====================================================

Purpose:
    Train on exactly 5 examples for 100 epochs.
    If the model can't memorize 5 examples, there's a bug.

Expected outcome:
    - Loss → ~0
    - Model reproduces training answers perfectly

TODO (Phase 3):
    - Select 5 samples from VQA-RAD
    - Fine-tune model on only these 5
    - Verify loss decreases to near zero
    - Verify model outputs match ground truth
