Experiment 05: Zero-Shot Generalization Evaluation
===================================================

Purpose:
    Test if the fine-tuned model generalizes to unseen concepts,
    replicating Section 6.2 of the paper.

Paper finding (Table 4):
    Med-PaLM M detected TB from chest X-rays at 87.68% accuracy
    despite never being trained on TB labels.

TODO (Phase 4):
    - Test on Slake-VQA after training only on VQA-RAD
    - Evaluate cross-dataset transfer
    - Test one-shot vs zero-shot prompting
