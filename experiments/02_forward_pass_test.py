Experiment 02: Forward Pass Test
================================

Purpose:
    Verify that the model loads and produces text output
    given an image + prompt, without any training.

TODO (Phase 2):
    - Load LLaVA-Med or BLIP-2 model
    - Pass one image + VQA prompt through
    - Verify it outputs coherent text (even if wrong)
